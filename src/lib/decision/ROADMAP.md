# ROADMAP

## Tasks
* parser
    + ==, <=, ...
    + arbitrary fields
* testing (see mc-decision branch)
* FDDs with integer fields + mapping between strings and integers
    + as in mc-decision, make policies polymorphic over field type  
    + need FDD comparison function
* CLI (see decision-and-felix branch)

## Possible Milestone:
* local decision procedure (dup-free programs)
