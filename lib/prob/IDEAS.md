## IDEAS

* Use sub-stochastic matrices instead of stochastic ones?
    - this should work!
    - -> done!
* Instead of using one global domain, refine domain during matrix compilation?
* local fields can help with state space explosion!
    - erased once they go out of scope


BLAS (lacaml):
* predicates = vectors
* not a = 1 - a
* convert to polish notation, allocate matrices ahead of time


# TODO:
* pass all arguments explicit (-> less computation)
* carefully examine allocation
* parser
