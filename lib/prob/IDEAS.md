## IDEAS

* Use sub-stochastic matrices instead of stochastic ones?
    - this should work!
    - -> done!
* Instead of using one global domain, refine domain during matrix compilation?
* more efficient predicate encoding!
    - arrays?
    - decision diagramms?
* local fields can help with state space explosion!
    - erased once they go out of scope


BLAS (lacaml):
* predicates = vectors
* not a = 1 - a
* convert to polish notation, allocate matrices ahead of time


# TODO:
* predicates (need at least and & or)
    - GADTs?
* parser
